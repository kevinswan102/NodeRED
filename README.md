# NodeRED

To start learning Node RED, I decided to implement a simple bot that has the ability to be accessed when Node Red is running through the messaging app “Telegram” after searching its name: “KevinIoTBot” and messaging it. For this project, I downloaded the library “node-red-contrib-chatbot” from the Node Red Library. The link can be found here: https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-chatbot . The bot begins by introducing itself and asking for the user’s name. It stores the name and refers to the user by their name. The bot has two capabilities which it asks the user if they would like to have it perform. The bot asks if the user would like to have an LED’s positive terminal connected to the user’s Raspberry Pi on pin 12 / GPIO 18 and the cathode connected to the ground. It parses the user’s response whether they answer ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ and performs accordingly. If they answer ‘Yes’, the LED on the pin should flash and then they are asked if they want to do the bot’s next ability, which is converting the user’s input to speech and reading it back to them.  The user answering ‘No’ will also cause the bot to ask this but will not flash the LED. Once again, the user can answer ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ on whether or not they want their text input to be read by the bot and sent in speech form as an audio file back to them. After the bot reacts accordingly, the bot will send a goodbye message. Additional text input can cause the program to restart.
